Interactive module for PtokaX's Lua interface via private message to a bots. Executes code immediately upon receiving it and echos it back. print has been implemented to mimic basic libs print.

The example shows you the most basic way to get an interactive window going.

buggyTo you probably want to use unless you're using CzDC, other clients have problems recieving PM's without a username.

1) Place sim.lua in your Lua path, which is by default your Hub directory, hub directory\libs, or hub directory\scripts\libs.

2) If you'd like to run the example put it in your scripts folder, change the string "Admin Name Here" to your nick and start the script, it will create a bot, PM imode to it for interactive mode. 

3) If you'd like to drop it into a script, it is as simple as calling the hook commands on the appropriate event arrivals, setting up your bot configuration, and admin users. All something done in the example.

There are a few functions in the module that are fun to play with. printfunc does just that, print replies back in PM, getlines is a tail like function, macro is an interesting higher-order function, but really just a toy. 

I haven't extensively tested cmdmode in Windows, but it should function with some quirks. It works well in *nix based systems, still with some quirks (Eg, using sudo prompts for a password, there is no way to enter the password, pipes are one way)
